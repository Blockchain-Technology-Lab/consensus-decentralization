class SolanaMapping(DefaultMapping):
    """
    Mapping class tailored to Solana data. Inherits from DefaultMapping.

    Solana differs from the default (Bitcoin-style) mapping in two ways, both reflected in the overriden methods below:
        - the identifier is the producing validator's vote account, a unique and permanent value,
        so it is matched exactly rather than as a substring
        - each block has exactly one reward address, the validator's identity account, so there
        is no need to iterate over multiple addresses.

    Note that in Solana the identifier (vote account) and the reward address (identity account) are distinct values,
    unlike Cardano where the pool hash serves as both.
